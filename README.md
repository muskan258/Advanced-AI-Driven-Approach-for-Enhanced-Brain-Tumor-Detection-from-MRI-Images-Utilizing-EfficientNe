# Advanced AI-Driven Approach for Enhanced Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images Utilizing EfficientNetB2 with Equalization and Homomorphic Filtering
Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images using AI introduces an AI-driven methodology for precise brain tumor detection in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, leveraging the EfficientNetB2 deep learning architecture. Incorporating advanced preprocessing techniques such as image cropping, equalization, and homomorphic filters, the model enhances MRI data quality, overcoming challenges posed by noise and varying image quality. With validation accuracies reaching 99.83%, 99.75%, and 99.2% on BD-BrainTumor, Brain-tumor-detection, and Brain-MRI-images-for-brain-tumor-detection datasets respectively, this approach promises refined clinical diagnostics and patient care by providing a more accurate and reliable means of identifying brain tumors from MRI images.
